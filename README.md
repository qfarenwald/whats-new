# What's New?

What's New? is a React App that displays different categories of current news.

### Focuses

Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.

Pass information between components using props.

Write readable JSX (your render methods/return statements should be clean and simple).

Use propTypes for every component receiving props.

Unit test React components including snapshot testing, methods, and changes in state.

Good commit habits - atomic commits that log small, focused changesets.
